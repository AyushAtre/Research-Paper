# CO2 -Emission: A Predictive Modeling with Diverse Regression 

# Overview
In present scenario CO2 Emission is one of the most important factors for the pollution. In this research paper, we applied different modeling 
approach to find most important factors due to CO2 Emission. In this study we applied statistical tools and techniques to understand the relationship between various factors and their impact on CO2 emission. We observed the CO2 emission by heavy and light-duty vehicles and studied the factors responsible for the growth of CO2 emission like, Cylinders, Fuel consumption in cities and highways, Fuel Types, Vehicle class, etc. We applied multiple linear regression model and estimated the coefficients. Also, we compared classical and machine learning approach and recorded the results. To address multicollinearity, we performed statistical technique such as Principal Component Analysis and recorded the better results.
